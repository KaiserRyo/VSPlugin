* [Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2013 SDK] (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40758)

Note: Currently, there is a bug in DIA SDK of Visual Studio 2013.
If Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 is installed on a machine where Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 was installed, the DIA SDK folder for Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 is installed in the DIA SDK folder for Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.

##Contributing
The BlackBerry Native Plug-in for Microsoft Visual Studio project currently contains the following code branches: 

**Master Branch** - This branch contains the latest production release of the source code. This code is considered stable and is fully tested by the test team. You can [download the binaries] (http://developer.blackberry.com/native/downloads/) from the Downloads page on the BlackBerry developer website.   

**Next Branch** - This branch contains the latest beta release of the source code. This code may be unstable and is not fully tested because it has passed unit tests only. At some point, a full regression test cycle is performed on the next branch and the code is promoted to the master branch.

**Feature Branch** - This branch contains the code changes required to implement specific features or issues being worked on for the next release. This code is considered unstable. These branches are denoted by the following naming scheme in the repository: next-### (where ### is the related issue number). When implementation is completed, the branch is unit and integration tested and then merged into the next branch.
